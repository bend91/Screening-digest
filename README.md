# Screening-digest
Python tool for identifying optimal enzymes to use for a screening digest.

run "python functions.py" from command line, you will be prompted for two DNA sequences, enter them and it will find enzymes that cut in an optimal way that will distinguish between the two sequences. Currently assumes all sequences are plasmids, will introduce functionality to choose either circular or linear sequences.

GUI is done from main.py, a work in progress using Pyside, not usable yet.
